This is a simple password generator. It uses the Random class to create a random password.
Run this program through the command line, and interact with the console.
WARNING: This tool is for educational use only and should not be used for securing sensitive information

Ethical considerations: The Random class is not good at truly random generation. This could cause serious 
security vulnerabilities. I don't believe someone could modify this to be malicious. They could potentially rig the randomization
and use that to gain access to private accounts. I would not be responsible for that though, since this program 
is so simple and I did not invent the concept of a password generator.
